# A simple JS static site generator

Designed to generate a homepage and posts that are linked properly in a nice and concise JS app. I made this in my free time as an educational exercise. The initial plan was to use it for a larger project but ended up setting it to the side in favor of Next.JS.

It's a fairly straightforward process, just run

```
npm run build
```

to generate the html pages from markdown in the content folder. I included a couple sample posts that can be generated immediately once pulled for easy reference.
